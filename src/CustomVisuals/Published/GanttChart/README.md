A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart which illustrates a project timeline or schedule. The Gantt Chart visual shows the Tasks, Start Dates, Durations, % Complete, and Resources for a project. The Gantt Chart visual can be used to show current schedule status using percent-complete shadings and a vertical "TODAY" line. The Legend may be used to group or filter tasks based upon data values.
